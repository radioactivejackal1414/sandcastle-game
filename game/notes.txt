tower based

TEAMS building competing sandcastles
- kind of like civ I guess, but very focused on cities
- map is a grid:

▞ 𝅙 𝅙 𝅙 𝅙
▉ ▗ ▉ 𝅙 𝅙
𝅙 ▉ ▗ ▉ 𝅙
▐ ▘ ▝ 𝅙 𝅙
𝅙 ▘ 𝅙 𝅙 𝅙

𝅙   Empty

▖	Quadrant lower left
▗	Quadrant lower right
▘   Quadrant upper left
▝	Quadrant upper right

▀	Upper half block
▄	Lower half block
▐	Right half block
▌	Left half block
▚	Quadrant upper left and lower right
▞	Quadrant upper right and lower left

▙	Quadrant upper left and lower left and lower right
▛	Quadrant upper left and upper right and lower left
▜	Quadrant upper left and upper right and lower right
▟	Quadrant upper right and lower left and lower right

▉   "Full" block

- you can build anywhere on the grid
- castles can attack neighboring castles
𝅙 . . . 𝅙
𝅙 . ▉ . 𝅙
𝅙 . . . 𝅙
𝅙 𝅙 𝅙 𝅙 𝅙
𝅙 𝅙 𝅙 𝅙 𝅙

- to win you conquer all the other castles
- to conquer castles you need to:
    - destroy them (space is left empty afterwards)
    - ransack them (you take over the castle using $ and infiltration)
- to DESTROY a castle:
    - you need to build weapons to your castles
        - to build weapons you need money
- to RANSACK a castle:
    - assign spies, give them money to bribe with, and give them X number of turns to win
- the more castles you have, the more expensive they are to maintain

- you can PROTECT your castles by building defenses:
    - moats
        - protects against thieves
    - guards
        - to infiltrate a castle, every guard must be bribed
        - guards cost money to maintain

- the game is round-based, each player takes a turn
    - on your turn, you:
        - build a new castle (if possible)
        - choose an action for each castle:
            - fortify (doubles defenses for this round)
            - upgrade (add weapons / add defenses)
            - attack (choose a target)
    - each round you're given money
    - on some rounds, the ocean will wear down defenses

- castles located at nearer edges of the board will:
    - generate more money
    - be more likely to be worn down by ocean water
